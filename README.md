# gas-station
---
This is my first project. It is a gas station simulator, where it shows on the screen cars being generated and whether or not they stop at the pumps.
It's still very early, very buggy...

 This program generates vehicles randomly and with some characteristics, such as: model, brand, type of fuel and quantities.
 After that it looks for a fuel pump available.
